# AHP-Analysis
Analyzes AHP Matrix for Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

This project contains two files:
1. ahp.py - instantiates the AHP class with all the necessary analysis functions. Also contains sample code to read from Decision 1.xlsx

2. Decision 1.xlsx - sample AHP spreadsheet -> please use this as reference when formatting your own input spreadsheets

3. Decision 1 AHP Output.xlsx - sample spreadsheet containing formatted statistics for Decision 1.xlsx

I coded this really quickly so documentation is pretty poor. If you run into errors or need more documentation, please contact me! (Matthew Zhang)
